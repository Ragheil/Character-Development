"Starting to Let Go"
Key: G major

Verse 1:
       G                          D
I told you how I felt that day
Em                  C
With trembling hands, I gave my heart away
       G                                 D
You looked at me with gentle eyes
    Em                                 C
But your silence spoke the final line

Pre-Chorus:
      Am                       C
You said you care, but not the same
      G                        D
Someone else had claimed your flame
     Am                  C
I watched you drift, I saw it through
     G                 D
It’s time to leave what isn’t true


Chorus:
    G                    D
You couldn’t love me, now I know
    Em              C
It’s time for me to let it go
G                   D
Even when I tried to win your hand
Em                    C
You said no, cause you've got your man
Am                     C
I won’t stay here in the shadows
G                    D
Loving you when love won’t follow
Am                         C
I won’t beg, I won’t fight
G            D               G
I’m stepping out into my own light

Verse 2:
G              D
I see you walking, smiling wide
Em                        C
With someone else there by your side
G                         D
I used to dream of what could be
Em              C
But now I see it's not for me

Pre-Chorus:
Am                C
You deserve the love you found
G               D
But I won’t stay here on the ground
Am                   C
I’ll lift myself, I’ll rise above
G                   D
To find my way, to find my love

Chorus:
G                    D
You couldn’t love me, now I know
Em                   C
It’s time for me to let it go
G                      D
Even when I tried to win your hand
Em                       C
You said no, cause you've got your man
Am                        C
I won’t stay here in the shadows
G                   D
Loving you when love won’t follow
Am                    C
I won’t beg, I won’t fight
G                   D               G
I’m stepping out into my own light

Bridge:
C             G
No more waiting, no more lies
Am                    Em
I’ve wiped the tears from my eyes
C                    G
I’ll be the one who’s moving on
Am                      D
Your chapter’s closed, my heart is strong

Chorus (Refrain):
G               D
You couldn’t love me, now I know
Em               C
It’s time for me to let it go
G                    D
Even when I tried to win your hand
Em                 C
You said no, cause you've got your man
Am                    C
But I won’t stay here in the shadows
G                 D
Loving you when love won’t follow
Am                     C
I won’t beg, I won’t fight
G              D              G
I’m stepping out into my own light

Outro:
C                     G
Though you’ll never be mine to hold
Am                    Em
I’m leaving now, my heart’s grown cold
C                     G
I’m free now, I’m free now
Am                 D              G
To find a love that’s mine somehow...
